# Hosteller and Day Scholar Identification system
The major goal of this project is to create a facial recognition-based identification system for
hostels and educational institutions in order to improve and update current identification
system (which is mainly id card checking by the guards) more efficiently and effectively.

Hostel environments require efficient and secure
entry management systems to cater to both
residents and day scholars. Our project aims to
address this need by developing a Hostel Entry
Recognition System powered by advanced face
recognition technology.
